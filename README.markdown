Perkūnas
========

> "Perkūnas" means "thunder" in Lithuanian.

This is a Lithuanian keyboard layout for MacOS X. It is basically
a minor deviation from standard numeric layout with the following
changes:

* The `§` remains on the same keys as in US layout;
* Same goes for `` ` `` (so I can switch between windows easily);
* The `Option` key (also known as `Alt`) forces the top key row (1!2@3#...) to behave like in US layout.

The layouts were created with [Ukele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=ukelele).

Installing
----------

Download the `Perkunas.keylayout` file. The icon (`Perkunas.icns`) is
nice to have as a visual indication, but not required otherwise.

* Open (or create) `Library/Keyboard Layouts` in your home directory.
* Put the files mentioned above inside that folder.
* (Recommended) Logout, login.
* Go to `International` preference pane, choose `Input menu` tab and put a tick by `Perkūnas`.

If you would, however, like to install the layout for all users, put the files in  `/Library/Keyboard Layouts` instead.
